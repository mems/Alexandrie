# `localStorage` quota limit

Note: Starting with iOS 5.1, Safari Mobile stores localStorage data in the cache folder, which is subject to occasional clean up, at the behest of the OS, typically if space is short. Safari Mobile's Private Browsing mode also prevents writing to localStorage entirely.

Note: the quota limit is expressed in bytes not in number of char. Non-ASCII char use more than one byte.
